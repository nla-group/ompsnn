## SNN: Fast and exact fixed-radius neighbor search



SNN is a fast and exact fixed-radius nearest neighbor search algorithm [1]. It uses the first principal component of the data to prune the search space and speeds up Euclidean distance computations using high-level BLAS routines. This repository contains the implementation of SNN in C++.
